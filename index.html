<h2>Introductions</h2>
<div class="intro">
    <p>Hello! My name is Robert Tung. I am a Class of 2020 graduate with a BS in Computer Engineering and a minor in Software Engineering from Clarkson University.
    Throughout my post-graduation, I have been focusing more into software engineering and development. Specifically, I am looking into AI/ML, AR/VR/XR, and game development with Unity. 
    I have been studying these topics either through courses on Coursera or through self-teachings on my own. I have also recently taken up learning about AWS and 
    currently hold a foundational certification, as can be seen on my resume.</p>
    <p>Right now I am developing with languages like Python, C/C++, and C# (for game dev). I have utilized Python for many projects such as: using it for machine learning, 
    creating a Discord bot with MongoDB integration, and designing a Django website. I am also currently in the works of hosting the Discord bot on AWS. I do all
    of this while searching for a job to keep myself busy and constantly learning.</p>
